    /// Drive the train forward pass BG1 at position 100m. Then, press the sensitive area C2-C4 and verify that no symbol is display. BG1: Packet 12, 21 and 27 (Entering FS).Continue to drive the train forward pass BG2 at position 200m. Then, stop the train and verify the display information of tunnel stopping symbol TC37 refer to received packet EVC-32.BG2: Packet 68 (Track condition)Press the sensitive area C2-C4 and verify the display of tunnel stopping symbols.Drive the train forward until the remaining distance on DMI is zero. Then, verify the display information of tunnel stopping symbol TC36 refer to received packet EVC-32.Continue to drive the train forward pass BG3 at position 400m. Then, stop the train and verify the display information of tunnel stopping symbol TC37 with remaining distance refer to received packet EVC-32.BG3: Packet 68 (Track condition)Continue to drive the train forward pass BG4 at position 600m. Then, stop the train and verify the display information of tunnel stopping symbol TC37 without remaining distance.BG3: Packet 68 (2 Track condition)Simulate the loss-communication between DMI and ETCS onboard. Then, verify that all tunnel stopping information is removed.Re-establish communication between DMI and ETCS onboard. Then, verify that all tunnel stopping information is resume to display.De-activate cabin and simulate the loss-communication between DMI and ETCS onboard. Then, verify that all tunnel stopping information is removed.Activate cabin and re-establish communication between DMI and ETCS onboard. Then, verify that all tunnel stopping information is resume to display.
