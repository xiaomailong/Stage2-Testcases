    /// 
    /// This test case verifies the display of the adhesion factor indication on DMI when the factor is activated by both driver
    /// and Trackside together.
    /// 
    /// Tested Requirements:
    /// MMI_gen 7088; MMI_gen 600; MMI_gen 8435;
    /// 
    /// Scenario:
    /// Drive the train past BG0 at position 100 m: packet 3 Q_NVDRIVER_ADHES = 0 (to reset the value if it has been set)
    /// Drive the train past BG1 at position 250 m: packet 3 Q_NVDRIVER_ADHES = 1
    /// 
    /// The adhesion factor indication is verified with the following events:
    /// 1. (Redundant Case) Activate Slippery button at Adhesion window.
    /// The ‘Adhesion’ button is revoked when the train passes BG2 at position 600 m:
    ///     packet 71 D_ADHESION = 0, L_ADHESION = 200, M_ADHESION = 0 (Slippery)
    /// Drive the train past length of reduced adhesion at 800 m. Deactivates Slippery button.
