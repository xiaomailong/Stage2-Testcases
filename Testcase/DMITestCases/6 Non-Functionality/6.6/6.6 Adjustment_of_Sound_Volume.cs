    /// Scenario:
    /// 1.Activate cabin A. Then, press the icon of ‘Settings menu’ button.
    /// 2.Press the icon of ‘Volume’ button. 
    /// 3.Press and hold the button ‘-‘ to decrease the acoustic volume until minimum level.
    /// 4.Simulate the communication loss between ETCS Onboard and DMI. Then, verifies the ATP down alarm sound volume is always play as maximum volume
