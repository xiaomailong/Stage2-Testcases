DMI shall support driver’s adjustment of the brightness of the display and possible to adjust the brightness to a defined minimum level. The properties and the presentation of the Brightness window shall comply with [ERA] standard and [MMI-ETCS-gen].

    /// Scenario:
    /// Open Settings window.Press icon of ‘Brightness’ button. And then, press the button to respectively decrease the luminance.The luminance will be decreased until minimum level.Adjust again by pressing the button to increase the luminance to maximum level.Deactivate and activate cabin again. Then, open Brightness window and verifes display information.Enter and confirm maximum value of luminance.Deactivate and activate cabin again. Then, open Brightness window and verifes display information.
