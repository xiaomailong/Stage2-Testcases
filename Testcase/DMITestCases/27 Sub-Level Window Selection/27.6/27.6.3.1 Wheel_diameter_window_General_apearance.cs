            Action: Press ‘Wheel diameter’ button
            Expected Result: DMI displays Wheel diameter window.Verify the following information,Data Entry WindowThe window title is ‘Wheel diameter’.The text label of the window title is right aligned.The following objects are displayed in Wheel diameter window,  Enabled Close button (NA11)Window TitleInput fieldsThe following objects are additionally displayed in Wheel diameter window,Yes buttonThe text label ‘Wheel diameter entry complete?’Yes button is displayed in Disabled state as follows,Text label is black Background colour is dark-greyThe border colour is medium-grey the same as the input field’s colour.The sensitive area of Yes button is extended from text label ‘Wheel diameter entry complete?’Input fieldsThe input fields are located on Main area D and F.Each input field is devided into a Label Area and a Data Area.The Label Area is give the topic of the input field.The Label Area text is displayed corresponding to the input field i.e. Wheel diameter 1 (mm), Wheel diameter 2 (mm), Accuracy (mm). The Label Area is placed to the left of The Data Area.The text in the Label Area is aligned to the right.The value of data in the Data Area is aligned to the left.The text colour of the Label Area is grey and the background colour of the Label Area is dark-grey.There are only 3 input fields displayed in the first page of window.The first input field is in state ‘Selected’ as follows,The background colour of the Data Area is medium-grey.The colour of data value is black.All other input fields are in state ‘Not selected’ as follows,The background colour of the Data Area is dark-grey.The colour of data value is grey.KeyboardThe keyboard associated to selected input field ‘Wheel diameter 1’ is Numeric keyboard.The keyboard contains enabled button for the number <1> to <9>, <Delete>(NA21) , <0> and disabled <Decimal_Separator>. NA21, Delete button.LayersThe level of layers of all areas in window are in Layer 0.Echo TextsAn echo text is composed of Label Part and Data Part.The Label Part of an echo texts is same as The Label area of an input fields.The echo texts are displayed in main area A, B, C and E with same order as their related input fields.The Label part of echo text is right aligned.The Data part of echo text is left aligned.The colour of texts in echo texts are grey.Entering CharactersThe cursor is flashed by changing from visible to not visible.The cursor is displayed as horizontal line below the value in the input field.Packet transmissionUse the log file to confirm that DMI received packet information [MMI_CURRENT_MAINTENANCE_DATA (EVC-40)] with variable MMI_Q_MD_DATASET = 0.The data part of input field and echo text are displayed correspond with the variables in received packet EVC-40 as follows,MMI_M_SDU_WHEEL_SIZE_1 = Wheel diameter 1MMI_M_SDU_WHEEL_SIZE_2 = Wheel diameter 2MMI_M_WHEEL_DIZE_ERR = AccuracyGeneral property of windowThe Wheel diameter window is presented with objects and buttons which is the one of several levels and allocated to areas of DMI. All objects, text messages and buttons are presented within the same layer.The Default window is not displayed and covered the current window
