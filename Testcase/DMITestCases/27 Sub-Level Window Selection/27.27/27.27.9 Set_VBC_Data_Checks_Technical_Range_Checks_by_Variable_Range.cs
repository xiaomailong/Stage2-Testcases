    /// 
    /// This test case verifies the functionalities of ‘Set VBC’ data entry when the VBC code does not comply with variable-range rules of the technical range check. The function designs comply with the conditions in [MMI-ETCS-gen]. The data range and interface comply with the data information in [VSIS_gen].
    /// 
    /// Tested Requirements:
    /// 1. Set VBC Window: MMI_gen 9901; MMI_gen 9905; MMI_gen 9923 (partly: the ‘Enter’ button, accepted data complied with data checks, driver action);2. Data Checks: MMI_gen 8328 (partly: MMI_gen 12148 (partly: MMI_gen 4713 (partly: indication))), MMI_gen 9888 (partly: reactions to failing and succeed, EVC-18, MMI_gen 4713, MMI_gen 12145, MMI_gen 12147, MMI_gen 12148, MMI_gen 4714, MMI_gen 9286 (partly: the ‘Enter’ button, switched state, disabled, enabled)), MMI_gen 9898 (partly: MMI_gen 12148 (partly: MMI_gen 4713 (partly:red))); MMI_gen 4699 (technical range);
    /// 
    /// Scenario:
    /// 1.Activate the cabin.
    /// 2.Press the ‘Settings’ button. Then, the ‘Settings’ window is opened from the ‘Driver ID’ window
    /// 3.Press the ‘Set VBC’ button. Then, the ‘Set VBC’ window is opened.
    /// 4.Enter a VBC code. Then, the ‘Set VBC’ window is verified by the following events:a.   The minimum DMI-technical-inbound VBC code is entered and accepted.b.   The DMI-technical-outbound VBC code is entered and accepted.c.   The maximum DMI-technical-inbound VBC code is entered and accepted.Note: The appearance of highlighting in data area has remained in DMI since BL-2 requirement [MMI-ETCS-gen BL2].
