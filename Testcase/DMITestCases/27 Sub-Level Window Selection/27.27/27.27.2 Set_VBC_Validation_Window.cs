            Press ‘Yes’ button
            Expected Result: Verify the following information,
            Use the log file to confirm that DMI received the packet MMI_ECHOED_SET_VBC_DATA (EVC-28). 
            DMI displays Set VBC Validation window.
            The following objects are displayed in Set VBC Validation window.
