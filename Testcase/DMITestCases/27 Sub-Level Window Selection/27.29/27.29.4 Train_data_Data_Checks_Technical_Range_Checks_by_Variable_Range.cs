    /// This test case verifies the functionalities of ‘Train data’ data entry when the data of Train data does not comply with variable-range rules of the technical range check. The function designs comply with the conditions in [MMI-ETCS-gen]. The data range and interface comply with the data information in [VSIS_gen].

    /// 5.Enter the numeric data of Train data, i.e. the maximum train length, maximum train speed, brake percentage. Then, the ‘Train data’ window is verified by the following events:      a. The minimum DMI-technical-inbound VBC code is entered and accepted.      b. The DMI-technical-outbound VBC code is entered and accepted.      c.
