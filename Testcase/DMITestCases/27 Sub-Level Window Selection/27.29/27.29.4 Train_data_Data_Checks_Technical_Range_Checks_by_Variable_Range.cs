    /// TC-ID: 22.29.4
    /// 
    /// This test case verifies the functionalities of ‘Train data’ data entry when the data of Train data does not comply with variable-range rules of the technical range check. The function designs comply with the conditions in [MMI-ETCS-gen]. The data range and interface comply with the data information in [VSIS_gen].
    /// 
    /// Tested Requirements:
    /// 1. Train data Window: MMI_gen 9413;2. Data Checks: MMI_gen 8089 (partly: reactions to failing and succeed, EVC-18, MMI_gen 4713, MMI_gen 12145, MMI_gen 12147, MMI_gen 12148, MMI_gen 4714, MMI_gen 9286 (partly: the ‘Enter’ button, switched state, disabled, enabled)), MMI_gen 9404 (partly: MMI_gen 12148 (partly: MMI_gen 4713 (partly:red))); MMI_gen 4699 (technical range);
    /// 
    /// Scenario:
    /// 1.Activate the cabin.
    /// 2.Perform SoM until mode SR is confirmed in the default window.
    /// 3.Press the ‘Main’ button. Then, the ‘Main’ window is opened.
    /// 4.Press the ‘Train data’ button. Then, the ‘Train data’ window is opened.
    /// 5.Enter the numeric data of Train data, i.e. the maximum train length, maximum train speed, brake percentage. Then, the ‘Train data’ window is verified by the following events:      a. The minimum DMI-technical-inbound VBC code is entered and accepted.      b. The DMI-technical-outbound VBC code is entered and accepted.      c. The maximum DMI-technical-inbound VBC code is entered and accepted.
