    /// TC-ID: 22.28.9
    /// 
    /// This test case verifies the functionalities of ‘Remove VBC’ data entry when the VBC code does not comply with variable-range rules of the technical range check. The function designs comply with the conditions in [MMI-ETCS-gen]. The data range and interface comply with the data information in [VSIS_gen].
    /// 
    /// Tested Requirements:
    /// 1. Remove VBC Window: MMI_gen 9920; MMI_gen 9924 (partly: the ‘Enter’ button, accepted data complied with data checks, driver action);2. Data Checks: MMI_gen 8339 (partly: MMI_gen 12148 (partly: MMI_gen 4713 (partly: indication))), MMI_gen 9912 (partly: reactions to failing and succeed, EVC-19, MMI_gen 4713, MMI_gen 12145, MMI_gen 12147, MMI_gen 12148, MMI_gen 4714, MMI_gen 9286 (partly: the ‘Enter’ button, switched state, disabled, enabled)), MMI_gen 9913 (partly: MMI_gen 12148 (partly: MMI_gen 4713 (partly:red))); MMI_gen 4699 (technical range);
    /// 
    /// Scenario:
    /// Activate the cabin.Press the ‘Settings’ button. Then, the ‘Settings’ window is opened from the ‘Driver ID’ windowAdd VBC code “16777215” in the ‘Set VBC’ data entry window.When the ‘Set VBC’ procedure is completed, the ‘Settings’ window appears.Press the ‘Remove VBC’ button. Then, the ‘Remove VBC’ window is opened.Enter a VBC code. Then, the ‘Remove VBC’ window is verified by the following events:The minimum DMI-technical-inbound VBC code is entered and accepted.The DMI-technical-outbound VBC code is entered and accepted.The maximum DMI-technical-inbound VBC code is entered and accepted.
