    /// 27.28.3 ‘Remove VBC’ Data Checks: Technical Range Checks by Data Validity
    /// TC-ID: 22.28.3
    /// 
    /// This test case verifies the functionalities of the ‘Remove VBC’ data entry when the VBC code does not comply with data-validity rules of the technical range check. The function designs comply with the conditions in [MMI-ETCS-gen]. The data range and interface comply with the data information in [VSIS_gen].
    /// 
    /// Tested Requirements:
    /// 1. Remove VBC Window: MMI_gen 9916; MMI_gen 9920; MMI_gen 9924 (partly: the ‘Enter’ button, accepted data complied with data checks, driver action);2. Data Checks: MMI_gen 8339 (partly: MMI_gen 12148 (MMI_gen 4713 (partly: indication)); MMI_gen 9912 (partly: reactions to failing and succeed, EVC-19, MMI_gen 4713, MMI_gen 4714, MMI_gen 4679, MMI_gen 9286 (partly: the ‘Enter’ button, disabled, enabled), MMI_gen 12147, MMI_gen 12148); MMI_gen 9913 (partly: MMI_gen 12148 (MMI_gen 4713 (partly: red)); MMI_gen 9310 (partly: technical range);
    /// 
    /// Scenario:
    /// 1.Activate the cabin.
    /// 2.Press the ‘Settings’ button. Then, the ‘Settings’ window is opened from the ‘Driver ID’ window.
    /// 3.Add VBC code “65536” in the ‘Set VBC’ data entry window.When the ‘Set VBC’ procedure is completed, the ‘Settings’ window appears.
    /// 4.Press the ‘Remove VBC’ button. Then, the ‘Remove VBC’ window is opened.
    /// 5.Enter a VBC code. Then, the ‘Remove VBC’ window is verified by the following events:a.   Enter and accept the invalid data. b.   Accept the previuos invalid data without re-enter in order that DMI does not send out any packets (The ‘Enter’ button is disabled).c.   Repeat a. and b. in order that the invalid data is re-entered and accepted although the ‘Enter’ button is disabled.d.   Repeat a. by valid data in order that the data is entered and accepted after the ‘Enter’ button is disabled.Note: The appearance of highlighting in data area has remained in DMI since BL-2 requirement [MMI-ETCS-gen BL2].
