    /// 27.22.6 ‘Brake percentage’ Data Checks: Technical Range Checks by Variable Range
    /// TC-ID: 22.22.6
    /// 
    /// This test case verifies the functionalities of ‘Brake percentage’ data entry when the data of Brake percentage does not comply with variable-range rules of the technical range check. The function designs comply with the conditions in [MMI-ETCS-gen]. The data range and interface comply with the data information in [VSIS_gen].
    /// 
    /// Tested Requirements:
    /// MMI_gen 11823 (partly: MMI_gen 4713, MMI_gen 12145, MMI_gen 12147, MMI_gen 12148, MMI_gen 4714, MMI_gen 9286 (partly: the ‘Enter’ button, switched state, disabled, enabled)); MMI_gen 4699 (technical range);
    /// 
    /// Scenario:
    /// 1.Configure the ATP-CU to enable level ‘ATC-2’
    /// 2.Activate the cabin.
    /// 3.Perform SoM until mode SR is confirmed in the default window.
    /// 4.Press the ‘Settings’ button. Then, the ‘Settings’ window is opened.
    /// 5.Press the ‘Brake’ button. Then, the ‘Brake’ window is opened.
    /// 6.Press the ‘Brake percentage’ button. Then, the ‘Brake percentage’ window is opened.
    /// 7.Enter Brake percentage. Then, the ‘Brake percentage’ window is verified by the following events:a.   The minimum DMI-technical-inbound data of Brake percentage is entered and accepted.b.   The DMI-technical-outbound data of Brake percentage is entered and accepted.c.   The maximum DMI-technical-inbound data of Brake percentage is entered and accepted.
