    /// Scenario:
    /// 1. Perform SoM to Level 1 in SR mode.
    /// 2. Drive the train forward with speed at 40 km/h.
    /// 3. Train runs pass BG1 at position 100 m.that contained pkt 12, pkt 21 and pkt 27 to enter FS mode.
    /// 4. Accelerate the train with max acceleration (100% throttle) above permitted speed.
    /// 5. Stop the train.
    /// 6. Use XML script to send EVC-1 to the DMI.
    /// 7. Deactivate cabin A and power off the system.
    /// 8. Power on the system and perform SoM to Level 1 in SR mode.
    /// 9. Drive the train forward with speed at 40 km/h.
    /// 10. Train runs pass BG1 at position 100 m.that contained pkt 12, pkt 21 and pkt 27 to enter FS mode.
    /// 11. Accelerate the train with max acceleration (100% throttle) until speed at 95 km/h.
