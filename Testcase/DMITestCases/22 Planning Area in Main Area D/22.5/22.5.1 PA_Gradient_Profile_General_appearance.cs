    /// This test case verifies that when DMI receives the data packet of gradient profiles from ETCS Onboard, the PA Gradient Profile displays in sub-area D5 correctly for uphill, downhill and zero gradient. Also verify the situation of communication lost, PAGP shall be removed. The PA Gradient Profile shall comply with [ERA-ERTMS] standard.
