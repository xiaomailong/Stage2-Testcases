    /// Activate cabin A. Perform SoM to SR mode, level 1.Drive the train pass BG1 at 100m. Then, verify that the Zoom PA function is enabled.Press ‘Scale Up’ button until the distance scale is the lowest value. Then, verify that the scale up button is disabled.Press ‘Scale Up’ button. Then, verify that PA’s distance scale is not change. Press ‘Scale Down’ button. Then, verify that scale up button is enabled.Press ‘Hide’ button. Then, verify that the scale up button is hidden.
