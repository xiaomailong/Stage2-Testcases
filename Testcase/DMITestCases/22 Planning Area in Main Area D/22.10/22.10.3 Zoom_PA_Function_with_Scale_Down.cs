    /// This test case verifies the properties of Scale Down button in Zoom PA function. When driver pressed the NA04 symbol to zoom out the planning area information, the scale range on the planning area shall change. The Scale down button shall comply with [ERA-ERTMS] standard.
    /// 
    /// Tested Requirements:
    /// MMI_gen 7379; MMI_gen 7384; MMI_gen 7385; MMI_gen 7388; MMI_gen 7373;

    /// Scenario:
    /// Activate cabin A. Perform SoM to SR mode, level 1.Drive the train pass BG1 at 100m.Driver the train follow with permitted speed. Then, verify that the Scale Down button is enabled.Press ‘Scale Down’ button until the highest distance range. Then, verify that the scale down button is disabled.Press ‘Scale Down’ button. Then, verify that PA’s distance scale is not change. Press ‘Scale Up’ button. Then, verify that scale down button is enabled.Press ‘Hide’ button. Then, verify that the scale down button is hidden.
