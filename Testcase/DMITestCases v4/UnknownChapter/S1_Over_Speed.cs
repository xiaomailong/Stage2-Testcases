    /// Tested Requirements:
    /// MMI_gen 11919;

    /// Scenario:
    /// 1.Perform SoM to Level 1 in SR mode.
    /// 2.Drive the train forward with speed at 40 km/h.
    /// 3.Train runs pass BG1 at position 100 m. that contained pkt 12, pkt 21 and pkt 27 to enter FS mode.
    /// 4.Stop the train.
    /// 5.Use XML script to send EVC-1 to the DMI.
